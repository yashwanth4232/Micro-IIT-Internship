Number Guessing Game 🎯
📌 Overview
The Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a predefined range. The game provides hints by indicating whether the guess is too high or too low, helping players refine their choices. With a limited number of attempts, it adds an exciting challenge to the gameplay.

✨ Features
🔢 Random number generation within a specified range

💡 Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low

🎯 Configurable number of attempts

🎮 Simple and engaging gameplay

📌 Option to play again after winning or losing

🎮 How to Play
The game will generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).

The player inputs a guess.

The game will indicate if the guess is too high or too low.

The player continues guessing until they find the correct number or run out of attempts.

If the player guesses correctly, they win! 🎉

If the player exhausts all attempts, the correct number is revealed.

🛠️ Installation & Setup
Requirements
Python 3.x (if implementing in Python)

Basic command-line interface (CLI)
📊 Sentiment Analysis (AI / ML)
📌 Overview
Sentiment Analysis is a machine learning project that analyzes text data to determine the emotional tone behind it—classifying sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. This process leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning algorithms to interpret text and predict user sentiment towards products, services, or brands.

✨ Features
✅ Sentiment classification into Positive, Negative, or Neutral
✅ Uses NLP techniques for text preprocessing
✅ Implements Machine Learning models for prediction
✅ Can be applied to social media, customer reviews, and more
✅ Supports custom dataset training and testing

🚀 How It Works
Data Collection: Gather text data from sources like customer reviews, social media, or surveys.

Text Preprocessing: Clean and tokenize text (remove stopwords, punctuation, stemming, etc.).

Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical representations (TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, etc.).

Model Training: Train an ML model (e.g., Naïve Bayes, SVM, LSTM) on labeled sentiment data.

Prediction: The trained model predicts the sentiment of new, unseen text.
